Poon&lt;/summary&gt;<b>Abstract:</b> Recent progress in machine learning practice has lead to the conclusion that over-parametrisation was an essential ingredient in the success of deep neural networks. In this talk, I will survey the recent achievements by many authors from the applied mathematics community for unveiling the reasons why, contrarily to standard belief, overfitting is not the rule when the number of parameters largely exceeds the size of the training set. In particular we will explain the importance of the recently discovered "double descent phenomenon" by Belkin, Hsu, Ma and Mandal. We will end the presentation with a new proposal for studying this intriguing phenomenon and present novel results in this direction obtained jointly with E. Caron in the finite sample and subGaussian setting. &lt;/details&gt; &lt;/td&gt;

The main idea is to study the dynamics when the width of the hidden layer goes to infinity, which is a Wasserstein gradient flow. While this dynamics evolves on a non-convex landscape, we show that its limit is a global minimizer if initialized properly. We also study the "implicit bias" of this algorithm when the objective is the unregularized logistic loss. We finally discuss what these results tell us about the generalization performance.

First, we will discuss how gradient descent when applied to unpenalized least squares regression solves the problem of reconstructing a sparse signal from an underdetermined system of linear measurements under the restricted isometry assumption. We present a statitically and computationally optimal algorithm for this problem in this setting and compare the behaviour to the explicit l_1 penalized versions. Next, we will discuss statistical guarantees on excess risk of early-stopped unconstrained mirror descent when applied to the unregularized empirical risk with squared loss on linear models. We will discuss the connection to offset Rademacher complexities and use our method to derive short proofs for new and existing results in the recent literature.

The former does not need any elaboration. The latter refers to the fact that the performance of modern machine learning algorithms depends sensitively on the choice of the hyperparameters. This talk centers on continuous formulations of machine learning that are ``well-posed''. We formulate machine learning and the associated optimization process as well-behaved variational and PDE-like problems, and demonstrate that some of the most popular modern machine learning algorithms can be recovered as particular discretizations of these continuous problems. We demonstrate that the performance of the algorithms obtained this way tends to be more robust with the different choices of the hyperparameters. We also discuss how to develop new algorithms under this framework. </details> </td>

In supervised learning, these parameters are optimised to match training data in the best possible way. The data are propagated through the layers by nonlinear transformations, and in an important subclass of models (ResNet) the transformation can be seen as the numerical flow of a certain type of continuous vector field. Ruthotto and Haber (2017) as well as Cheng et al. have experimented in using different type of vector fields to improve the deep learning model. In particular it is of interest that the trained model has good long time behaviour and are stable in the deep limit, when the number of layers tends to infinity. The models presented in the literature have certain builtin structural properties, they can for instance be gradient flows or Hamiltonian vector fields. A difficulty is however that the models are not autonomous and therefore it is less clear what their flows actually preserve. Starting from such ResNet vector fields, we shall discuss their properties and derive some new nonlinear stability bounds. The long time behaviour of these neural ODE flows is important in the generalisation mode, i.e. after the model has been trained. But also in the training algorithm itself,  structure preserving numerical schemes are important. In deep learning models, the use of gradient flows for optimisation is prevalent, and there exists a number of different algorithms that can be used, some of them can be interpreted as approximations of the flow of certain vector fields with dissipations, such as conformal Hamiltonian systems. If time permits, we will briefly discuss also these algorithms and in particular the need for and efficiency of regularisation.

We consider recent work by Haber and Ruthotto 2017 and Chang et al. 2018, where deep learning neural networks have been interpreted as discretisations of an optimal control problem subject to an ordinary differential equation constraint. We review the first order conditions for optimality, and the conditions ensuring optimality after discretisation.  There is a growing effort to mathematically understand the structure in existing deep learning methods and to systematically design new deep learning methods to preserve certain types of structure in deep learning.

The availability of powerful algorithms in a wide range of programming language and implementations has facilitated this, enabling almost anyone to use these tools. However, without sufficient understanding of the models, data, mathematics or statistics, interpretation of outputs from machine learning can be difficult or misleading. The explainability of machine learning is a growing area of research and becoming increasingly important in application areas such as healthcare. Similarly, the challenges of trustworthiness, robustness and uncertainty in machine learning, as well as the data they are tried on, are significant issues in many applications. These align well with metrological concepts of traceability, calibration, uncertainty propagation and standardisation, which can help address these challenges in machine learning. Several areas will be discussed including fundamentals of machine learning and data, and applications to imaging and non-imaging data such as in healthcare domains. 	  </details>  </td>

Optimal transport (OT) is another mathematical framework that has recently received significant attention from the computer vision community, for it provides means to transport one measure to another in an unsupervised manner. The cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (cycleGAN) is a recent extension of GAN to learn target distributions with less mode collapsing behavior. Although similar in that no supervised training is required, the algorithms look different, so the mathematical relationship between these approaches is not clear. In this talk, we provide an important advance to unveil the missing link. Specifically, we propose a novel PLS cost by imposing a deep learning-based inverse path as a regularization term. When used as a transportation cost for optimal transport formulation, this new PLS formulation leads to a novel cycleGAN architecture as a Kantorovich dual OT formulation. One of the most important advantages of this formulation is that depending on the knowledge of the forward problem, distinct variations of cycleGAN architecture can be derived: for example, one with two pairs of generators and discriminators, and the other with only a single pair of generator and discriminator. Experimental results using various inverse problems confirm the efficacy of the proposed method.  	  </details> </td>

Provable results that make useful predictions about a trained neural network, a Nyquist theorem for deep learning, seems very far off. In this talk, I'll instead focus on another use of mathematical theory in deep learning which has given several useful tools to engineers: expanding the toolbox of provably correct components in deep learning systems. By far the most useful such component has been backpropagation, but others have been discovered in recent years. I'll try to give an overview, discussing recent discoveries such as invertible networks and spectral normalization, before focusing on some of my recent work in provably correct deep learning accelerated convex optimization.

Based on remarkable approximation theoretical results of deep neural networks, in particular, of functions that arise as solutions of elliptic PDEs, it is natural to speculate that DNNs can improve the state of the art of numerical solvers for such problems. Due to the complexity and unreliability of the training of DNNs, this approach is, however, only feasible in special circumstances. An alternative is to train DNNs to approximate the solution map, i.e., the map taking parameters of a PDE to the solution. In this scenario, DNNs can be trained in an expensive offline phase, but the solution of an individual problem can then be computed very efficiently. A drawback of this approach is that the regularity of the solution map is much less understood than the regularities of the solutions of the individual PDEs. In this work, we study the complexity of the solution map through the lens of model order reduction techniques. In this context, we establish theoretical and practical bounds on the approximability of the solution map by DNNs.	  </details> </td>

In this talk we present a network architecture for forward and inverse problems in non-linear diffusion. By design the architecture is non-linear, learning an anisotropic diffusivity function for each layer from the output of the previous layer. The performed updates are explicit, by which we obtain better interpretability and generalisability compared to classical architectures. Since backward diffusion is unstable, a learned regularisation is implicitly learned to stabilise this process. We test results on synthetic image data sets that have undergone edge-preserving diffusion and on experimental data of images view through variable density scattering media.

While existing proof systems manipulating polynomial inequalities via elementary inference rules are known to be very powerful, searching for proofs remains a major difficulty. I will introduce a deep reinforcement learning framework to search for a dynamic proof within these proof systems, paying particular attention to incorporating inherent symmetries of the problem as an inductive bias. By comparing our approach with powerful and widely-studied linear programming hierarchies based on static proof systems, I will show that the proposed method reduces the size of the linear program by several orders of magnitude while also improving performance.

  </summary><b>Abstract:</b> Inverse problems in imaging range from tomographic reconstruction (CT, MRI, etc) to image deconvolution, segmentation, and classification, just to name a few. In this talk I will discuss approaches to inverse imaging problems which have both a mathematical modelling and a machine learning (data-driven) component. Mathematical modelling is crucial in the presence of ill-posedness, making use of prior information about the imaging data, for narrowing down the search space. Such an approach results in highly generalizable reconstruction and analysis methods which come with desirable solutions guarantees. Machine learning on the other hand is a powerful tool for customising methods to individual data sets. Their combination, getting the best from both of these worlds, is
the topic of this talk, furnished with examples for image classification under minimal supervision with an application to chest x-rays and task adapted tomographic reconstruction.

These systems now outperform humans in Chess and Go and show near-human performance in medical diagnosis, surpassing capabilities of previous-generation algorithms. Decision-making in these new systems is high-dimensional and data- or experience-driven, relying on thousands of variables with mutual dependencies and uncertainties. However, mounting evidence points to that the super-human ability of these AI to learn from huge volumes of data without prior knowledge of data models and distributions make their deductions vulnerable to data inconsistencies, poor data quality, fundamental data uncertainty, and human developers‚Äô bias, leading to poor output integrity and error. In this talk we will discuss a framework enabling high-dimensional data-driven AI to learn on-the-job and correct spurious errors without suffering from the so-called catastrophic forgetting.  We will show that the same framework can be used to develop a formal understanding of fundamental limitations of high-dimensional data-driven AI, including AI brittleness, lack of robustness, and vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. The new framework enables to produce explainable high-level specifications for the development of new-generation data-driven AI which are robust and resilient ‚Äúby design‚Äù.

However, DL has an Achilles heel: it is universaly unstable so that small changes in the initial data can lead to large errors in the final result. This has been documented in a wide variety of applications. Paradoxically, the existence of stable neural networks for these applications is guaranteed by the celebrated Universal Approximation Theorem, however, the stable neural networks are not computed by the current training approaches. We will address this problem and the potential limitations of AI from a foundations point of view. Indeed, the current situation in AI is comparable to the situation in mathematics in the early 20th century, when David Hilbert‚Äôs optimism (typically reflected in his 10th problem) suggested no limitations to what mathematics could prove and no restrictions on what computers could compute. Hilbert‚Äôs optimism was turned upside down by Goedel and Turing, who established limitations on what mathematics can prove and which problems computers can solve (however, without limiting the impact of mathematics and computer science).
   We predict a similar outcome for modern AI and DL, where the limitations of AI (the main topic of Smale‚Äôs 18th problem) will be established through the foundations of computational mathematics. We sketch the beginning of such a program by demonstrating how there exist neural networks approximating classical mappings in scientific computing, however, no algorithm (even randomised) can compute such a network to even 1-digit accuracy with probability better than 1/2. We will also show how instability is inherit in the methodology of DL demonstrating that there is no easy remedy, given the current methodology. Finally, we will demonstrate basic examples in inverse problems where there exists (untrained) neural networks that can easily compute a solution to the problem, however, the current DL techniques will need 10^80 data points in the training set to get even 1 percent success rate. 	  </details> </td>

This class of methods is often applied in conjunction with entropy regularization --- an algorithmic scheme that helps encourage exploration --- and is closely related to soft policy iteration and trust region policy optimization. Despite the empirical success, the theoretical underpinnings for NPG methods remain severely limited even for the tabular setting. This paper develops {\em non-asymptotic} convergence guarantees for entropy-regularized NPG methods under softmax parameterization, focusing on discounted Markov decision processes (MDPs). Assuming access to exact policy evaluation, we demonstrate that the algorithm converges at least linearly when computing optimal value functions of the regularized MDP. Moreover, the algorithm is provably stable vis-a-vis inexactness of policy evaluation. Our convergence results outperform the ones established for unregularized NPG methods, and shed light upon the role of entropy regularization in accelerating convergence.

We consider the setting where the environment (market) is adversarial, which results in a repeated two-person game. We are interested in the optimal strategies of the market and the player when the game is played over a long time. We identify PDE continuum limits for this game in the limit of infinite turns; we compute asymptotically optimal strategies for the player and for the environment by using the unique solution to the corresponding nonlinear PDE. We also developed numerical methods to solve this PDE numerically and we test the conjectured optimality of the COMB strategy.

To combat the problem of overfitting, it is common to employ some type of regularization scheme, either explicit penalty terms to control the weights, or implicit approaches such as early stopping or dropout. In this talk I will describe a method for efficiently incorporating algebraic constraints into a stochastic gradient Langevin framework for the training of deep neural networks. Constraints allow direct control of the parameter space of the model and can be used to replace both explicit and implicit regularization strategies. Appropriately designed, they can curb the vanishing/exploding gradient problem and control weight magnitudes and thus stabilize deep neural networks improving the robustness of training algorithms and the consequent generalization capabilities of the trained neural network. I will present examples, discussing both overdamped and underdamped Langevin schemes, distributional convergence issues and numerical discretization methods. The methods are explored in standard test examples from image classification and natural language processing.	  </details> </td>

The advantage of this new formulation is that its partial derivatives with respect to the network‚Äôs individual weight- and bias-terms do not require the computation of derivates of the individual activation functions. Instead of estimating the parameters with a subgradient-based optimisation algorithm (as is the state of the art), we therefore use a coordinate descent- or a tailored Bregman alternating direction method of multipliers (BADMM)-approach to train the network parameters; both approaches do not require the computation of subdifferentials of the activation functions. We conclude with preliminary numerical results and discuss potential applications.	  </details> </td>

Central in the success of G-CNNs is to lift feature maps to higher dimensional disentangled representations in which data characteristics are effectively learned, geometric data-augmentations are made obsolete, and predictable behavior under geometric transformations (equivariance) is guaranteed via group theory. Currently, however, the practical implementations of G-CNNs are limited to either discrete groups (that leave the grid intact) or continuous compact groups such as rotations (that enable the use of Fourier theory). In this talk I lift these limitations and propose a modular framework for the design and implementation of *G-CNNs for arbitrary Lie groups*. In this approach the differential structure of Lie groups is used to expand convolution kernels in a generic basis of B-splines that is defined on the Lie algebra. This leads to a flexible framework that enables *localized*, *atrous*, and *deformable convolutions* in G-CNNs by means of respectively *localized*, *sparse* and *non-uniform* B-spline expansions. The impact and potential of the approach is studied on two benchmark datasets: cancer detection in histopathology slides (PCAM dataset) in which rotation equivariance plays a key role and facial landmark localization (CelebA dataset) in which scale equivariance is important. In both cases, G-CNN architectures out-perform their classical 2D counterparts and the added value atrous and localized group convolutions is studied in detail. 	  </details> </td>

Networks allow us to dependence between nodes or actors. Understanding the difference between two networks is also challenging unless they share nodes and are of the same size. We shall discuss how we may compare networks and also consider the regime where more than one network is observed. We shall also discuss how to parametrize a distribution on labelled graphs in terms of a Frech√©t mean graph (which depends on a user-specified choice of metric or graph distance) and a parameter that controls the concentration of this distribution about its mean. Entropy is the natural parameter for such control, varying from a point mass concentrated on the Frech√©t mean itself to a uniform distribution over all graphs on a given vertex set. Networks present many new statistical challenges. We shall discuss how to resolve these challenges respecting the fundamental non-Euclidean nature of network observations.

In this context, Gaussian process regression is often used as a Bayesian inference procedure, and we are interested in the convergence as the number of data points goes to infinity. Hyper-parameters appearing in the mean and covariance structure of the Gaussian process prior, such as smoothness of the function and typical lenght scales, are often unknown and learnt from the data, along with the posterior mean and covariance. We work in the framework of empirical Bayes, where a point estimate of the hyper-parameters is computed, using the data, and then used within the standard Gaussian process prior to posterior update. Using results from scattered data approximation, we provide a convergence analysis of the method applied to a fixed, unknown function of interest. 	  </details> </td>

Given a subset of nodes the graph cut is the sum of all edges from the set to its complement. A balanced cut, of which the Cheeger cut is a special case, minimises the ratio of graph cut to a term that penalises small clusters. In this work we make connections between the Cheeger cut on the graph and recent results on the stability of isoperimetric inequalities on manifolds in order to show high probability rates of convergence of the discrete Cheeger cut to its continuum analogue.

Title: Looking into the black box: how mathematics can help to turn deep learning inside out

Abstract: Deep learning has had a transformative impact on a wide range of tasks related to Artificial Intelligence, ranging from computer vision and speech recognition to playing games. Still, the inner workings of deep neural networks are far from clear, and designing and training them is seen as almost a black art. In this talk we will try to open this black box a little bit by using mathematical structure of neural networks described by so-called differential equations and mathematical optimisation. The talk is furnished with several examples in image analysis and computer vision, ranging from biomedical imaging to remote sensing.

Time: 18.00 BST, Thursday 6th August 2020.
